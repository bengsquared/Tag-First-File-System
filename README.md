# Title Pending 
## a tag based filesystem
I might call this project "setup" or something of the like.

This app is meant to manage project-specific folders using content and idea-related tags to group items, rather than contraining files to be a single leaf node in a tree. What if symlinks, as an app.

This project uses create-react-app, Electron


### Code & code quality is a little WIP as the file graph structure may change.
